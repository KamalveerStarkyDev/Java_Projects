This To-Do-List Project needs 3 main tasks to be done
    1. insertion
    2. deletion
    3. display

and also it'll contain String type data in it, so the best data structure I could think of for this is ArrayList with String type.

We have default methods like, 
    1. size() // number of elements in the list
    2. add(E element) // adding element to the end of the list
    3. add(int index, E element) // adding element to a specific index
    3. remove(index) // removing an element on a particular index
    4. isEmpty() // to see if the list id empty
    5. contains(Object o) // checks if o is in the list, returns true if yes else false
    6. clear() // removes all the elements from the list
    7. subList(int fromIndex, int toIndex) // returns a sub list from the main one according to the arguments 

Now we just need to create an object of this list and then create a switch statement where we ask user which operation they want to perform and then call that specified method.

To make it re ask until user asks to exit we just create a while loop with argument as 'true' to keep it running again and again.

Then also create a option to exit out of the loop.

That's seems to be it to create a basic To-Do-List.
